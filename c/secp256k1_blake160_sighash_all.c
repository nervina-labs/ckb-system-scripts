// # secp256k1-blake160-sighash-all
//
// This is a lock script code using the same secp256k1 signature verification algorithm
// as used in bitcoin. When executed, it performs the blake2b hash (with "ckb-default-hash"
// used as the personalization value) on the following concatenated components:
//
// * The current transaction hash;
// * Take the witness of the same index as the first input using current lock script,
// treat it as a [WitnessArgs](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb/blob/1df5f2c1cbf07e04622fb8faa5b152c1af7ae341/util/types/schemas/blockchain.mol#L106)
// object using molecule serialization format, then fill in a 65-byte long value with all
// zeros in the lock field, the modified object is then serialized and used as the value to hash. Notice the
// length of the modified witness object is hashed first as a 64-bit unsigned little endian
// integer;
// * All the witnesses of the same indices as the remaining input cells with the same lock
// script as the current lock script to run. Notice the length of each witness is hashed
// before the corresponding witness as a 64-bit unsigned little endian integer;
// * All the witnesses which have index value exceeding the number of input cells. For
// example, if a transaction has 3 inputs, all witnesses with index equal to or larger than
// 3 will be hashed. Notice the length of each witness is hashed before the corresponding
// witness as a 64-bit unsigned little endian integer;
//
// The blake2b hash result is then used as a message to verify the recoverable signature
// provided in the lock field of the modified witness object mentioned above. From the
// recoverable signature, we can derive the public key, we then run another blake2b hash
// (with "ckb-default-hash" used as personalization), take the first 160 bit of the hashed
// result(hence the blake160 name), and compare those 160-bit values with what is stored in
// script args part of current running script. If they do match, the signature verification
// is succeeded.
//
// Note that we distinguish between lock script and lock script code here: when we say lock
// script code, we mean only the RISC-V binary compiled from the current C source file; when
// we say lock script, however, we mean the whole lock script including script args part. A
// consequence here, is that one transaction in CKB might contain input cells using the same
// lock script code here, but with different script args(hence different lock script), in
// those cases, this underlying lock script code will be executed multiple times when
// validating a single transaction, each time with a different lock script.

// First we will need to include a few headers here, for legacy reasons, this repository
// ships with those headers. We are now maintaining a new [repository](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb-c-stdlib)
// with most of those headers included. If you are building a new script, we do recommend
// you to take a look at what's in the new repository, and use the code there directly.
